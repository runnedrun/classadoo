	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			How did Classadoo start?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			The Classadoo co-founders are David Gaynor (CEO, co-founder and teacher) and Ari Chae (co-founder and teacher). David and Ari previously co-founded the nonprofit, <a href="http://schoolshaped.org">School Shaped</a>. Through listening to teachers, David and Ari discovered that coding lessons often lack context: coding should be a means to an end, not just an end. David and Ari decided to combine their tech and academic experience for Classadoo, a digital classroom that engages students with opportunities to create websites that are inspired by their passions. Classadoo teaches students to be <i>creators</i>, not just <i>coders</i>.

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			What is the Classadoo course structure?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			A Classadoo teacher will lead a weekly group session remotely for one hour. They provide help between sessions if needed and are available for scheduled 1:1 chats, responding to email within 24 hours. Level 2 and Advanced students will create projects that require some work outside of class.

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			What does a Classadoo session look like?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			We teach 2 types of classes: <b>local</b> and <b>distributed</b> sessions. Students are required to install the Classadoo chrome extension for both session types. This plugin allows our teachers to track students' progress. The Classadoo teachers and course content is the same for both session types.
			<br>
			<br>
			A local session is similar to a traditional course at school - except the Classadoo teacher is onscreen instead of there in-person. All you need is 1.) a screen that connects to a computer and 2.) a computer with internet access for each student. Local sessions are possible when there are enough interested students in a geographic area. Schools and homeschool groups usually organize local sessions.
			<br>
			<br>
			A distributed session, on the other hand, is a session that occurs without a physical classroom for students from different geographic areas. Students log into a secure live video stream from anywhere. They can ask teachers questions though audio, though their video is hidden from the Classadoo teacher and other participants.

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			Do students work together?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			Yes. We think collaboration is an important skill, so we encourage students to solve problems in groups during our local sessions. These sessions include a group project that students work on over multiple sessions.
			<br>
			<br>
			We are still working on ways to include group work in our distributed sessions.

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			Do all the students need to be there in person?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			Only for local sessions. Students are remote for our distributed sessions.
