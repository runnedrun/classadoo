			How do I sign up?

		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			If you'd like to bring a Classadoo at School trial to your school, after school program or homeschool group, just fill out our <a href="school-signup.html">brief info form</a>. Otherwise, if you'd like to sign up as an individual, enrollment will open for Classadoo at Home in August 2016.

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			What is the structure of a course?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			We usually teach one, hour long, live, remote session per week, for each course. Then our instructors are available between classes for remote help. Their responsiveness varies, but most teachers will respond to email questions the same day, and are often avaible for 1:1 chats. Most of our advanced courses include projects which students work on between classes. If you'd prefer a different structure (more or fewer classes per week, more or less homework), just email <a href="mailto:learn@classadoo.com">learn@classadoo.com</a>, and we'll design a course that meets your needs!

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			What does a classadoo session look like?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			We teach two kinds of classes: <b>Classadoo at School</b> and <b>Classadoo at Home</b>. 
			<br>
			<br>
			A Classadoo at School session looks very similar to to a normal class you might take in school, except the teacher is on a screen, instead of being there in person. So all that is needed is a room with internet, a screen you can connect to a computer, space and a computer for each student. We provide local classes when there are many interested students in the same geographic area. Usually these are organized by schools or homeschool groups.
			<br>
			<br>
			Classadoo at Home allows us to serve interested students from many different geographic areas. For these sessions there is no physical "classroom". Students log in to a secure, live video stream from anywhere. Their video is hidden from other participants and the teacher, but they can ask audio questions directly to the teacher at any time. Enrollment for our distributed courses will open in September 2016.
			<br>
			<br>
			Both types of courses utilize Classadoo's custom software to allow our instructors manage the class and give help exactly when it's needed. The content and teachers are the same for both types of class, with more group work in a Classadoo at School session.

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			Do students work together?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			<div>
				We think collaboration is one of the most important skills we can teach, so we frequently have students solve problems in groups during a Classadoo at School session. 
			</div>
			
			<div>
				We are still working on ways to include group work in our distributed sessions.

		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			Do all the students need to be there in person?
		</h4>

			Only for Classadoo at School. All students are remote for a Classadoo at Home session.

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			How did Classadoo start?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">			
			David, our CEO, and one of our teachers, previously founded the nonprofit <a href="http://schoolshaped.org">School Shaped</a>, along with Ari, another one of our teachers. While working on School Shaped David and Ari visited many schools, and talked to many teachers. They found that classes, especially coding classes, often lacked context. After all, code is just a means to an end, not an end itself. David and Ari wanted to enable students to do what they had done: use code to pursue their passions, whatever those were. So, with the help of other teachers and professionals, they created a series of courses where students work on the kind of projects professionals create everyday. The curriculum was tested and honed through three remote pilots in early 2016, and continues to be developed through David's work at Nueva School and Design Tech High School, where he teaches Entrepreneurship and Computer Science. Our mission: teach courses accross the country which engage students with practical, hands on lessons, and help them become <i>creators</i> not <i>coders</i>.
