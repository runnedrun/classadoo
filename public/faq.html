		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			Who are your teachers?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			Our teachers are all passionate educators, who work or have worked at some of the biggest names in tech: Twitter, SpaceX, Uber, Google and more. Check out our <a href="teachers.html">teachers page</a> for more info.
		</div>

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			What is pricing like?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			We generally charge $25 per student, per session, with discounts for large groups. For this we provide one hour long group session, homework (for some courses), and some availability for remote help in between sessions. However we're happy to set up introductory pricing if you'd like to try out a course. Just contact us at <a href="mailto:learn@classadoo.com">learn@classadoo.com</a>!

			How do I sign up?

		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			If you'd like to organize a local class for your school, after school program or homeschool groups contact us <a href="mailto:learn@classadoo.com">learn@classadoo.com</a>. Otherwise, enrollment will open for our summer 2016 distributed classes in May 2016.

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			What is the structure of a course?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			We usually teach one hour long, live, remote, group session per week, for each course. Then our instructors are available between classes for remote help. Their responsiveness varies, but most teachers will respond to email questions the same day, and are often avaible for 1:1 chats. Most of the Level II and above courses include projects which students work on between classes. If you'd prefer a different structure (more or fewer classes per week, more or less homework), just email <a href="mailto:learn@classadoo.com">learn@classadoo.com</a>, and we'll design a course that meets your needs!

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			What does a classadoo session look like?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			We teach two kinds of classes: <b>local</b> and <b>distributed</b>. 
			<br>
			<br>
			A local session looks very similar to to a normal class you might take in school, except the teacher is on a screen, instead of being there in person. So all that is needed is a room with internet, a screen you can connect to a computer, and space and a computer for each student. We provide local classes when there are many interested students in the same geographic area. Usually these are organized by schools or homeschool groups.
			<br>
			<br>
			We provide distributed classes when we have interested students from many different geographic areas. For these sessions there is no physical "classroom". Students log in to a secure, live video stream from anywhere. Their video is hidden from other participants and the teacher, but they can ask audio questions directly to the teacher at any time. Enrollment for our distributed courses will open in May 2016.
			<br>
			<br>
			For both types of courses students are required to install the Classadoo chrome extension. This plugin allows our teachers to track students' progress on tasks, and alerts them if a student gets off task. The content and teachers are the same for both types of class, with more group work in a local session.

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			Do students work together?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			We think collaboration is one of the most important skills we can teach, so we frequently have students solve problems in groups, during local sessions. Most local classes also include at least one group project that students work on over multiple sessions.
			<br>
			<br>
			We are still working on ways to include group work in our distributed sessions.

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			Do all the students need to be there in person?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			Only for local sessions. All students are remote for our distributed classes.

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			How did Classadoo start?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			David, our CEO, and one of our teachers, previously founded the nonprofit <a href="http://schoolshaped.org">School Shaped</a>, along with Ari, another one of our teachers. While working on School Shaped David and Ari visited many schools, and talked to many teachers. They found that classes, especially coding classes, often lacked context. After all, code is just a means to an end, not an end itself. We wanted to enable kids to do what we had done: use code to pursue their passions, whatever those were. So we combined our previous experience building computer science curriculum with our practical experience working for big name and startup tech companies, to create courses which engage students with practical, hands on lessons, and help them become <i>creators</i> not <i>coders<i>.
